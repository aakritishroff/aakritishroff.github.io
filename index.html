  <h2>Hello, World!<br/><span style="font-size: 70%; color:gray;">Crosscloud Demo Application</span></h2>

	<p class="note">This is a variation on the concept of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program">Hello, World program</a>.  With this one, the user actually says Hello to everyone else who runs the program.  So it's more complicated that just displaying a string, but it's still quite simple for a multi-user Web Application.  You should be able to save this page (with the associated <a href="hello.hs">hello.js</a> to your local filesystem and run them from there (or another Web server), modifying them as you like -- still working with the same multi-user data.</p>

	<p>Hello from: 
	<input id="nick" type="text" placeholder="your name (optional)" size="20" />
	<button id="helloButton">Hello, World!</button>
